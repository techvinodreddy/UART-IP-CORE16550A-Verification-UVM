# UART-IP-CORE16550A-Verification-UVM
The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) core provides serial  communication capabilities, which allow communication with modem or other external  devices, like another computer using a serial cable and RS232 protocol. This core is  designed to be maximally compatible with the industry standard National  Semiconductorsâ€™ 16550A device. 

This is Half Duplex
